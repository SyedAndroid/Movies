He starts with making his own kind of please-turn-off-your-cell-phone announcement, as well as a warning not to text or tweet during the show: �Just live your life,� he asks. Whether he�s talking about a unique way to drop a rental car off at an airport or describing why a man in his 40s should not smoke dope, it�s terrific, humane, carried-to-crazed-extremes stuff.",
